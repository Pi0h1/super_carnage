# super_carnage

Super Carnage is Hotline Miami's original prototype.

This project began in 2004 by cactusquid (Jonatan Söderström). It was originally released on a Game Maker forum that same year as an open-source top-down-shooter engine for the community to check out.

This repository is based on a 2006 revision of the project by its author.

It has been reported that users from the Game Maker community at the time used this project to create their own games but sadly none have been re-discovered in recent years.

Super Carnage was considered lost for years until reddit user /u/cars2forthegba found it in 2019 (https://old.reddit.com/r/HotlineMiami/comments/cahjbb/not_sure_if_anyone_found_this_before_but_heres/)

The project file was in a .gm6 format mean to be read by Game Maker 6. That file was ported to Game Maker 7.0, from there to GameMaker: Studio 1.4 and from there to GameMaker Studio 2.3
