# super_carnage

Super Carnage is Hotline Miami's original prototype.

This project began in 2004, the year in which it was originally released in Game Maker forums as a top-down-shooter engine, a revision was made in 2006.
User used this project to create their own games, sadly none have been re-discovered in recent years.

It was considered lost for years until reddit user /u/cars2forthegba found it in 2019 (https://old.reddit.com/r/HotlineMiami/comments/cahjbb/not_sure_if_anyone_found_this_before_but_heres/)

The project file was in a .gm6 format mean to be read by Game Maker 6. That file was ported to Game Maker 7.0, from there to GameMaker: Studio 1.4 and from there to GameMaker Studio 2.3.
